            <b>Narutois</b> a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by <b>Masashi Kishimoto</b>. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki,<br>
            a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told <br>
            in two parts—the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by <br>
            <b>Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995)</b>, which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following <br>
            year, and Naruto (1997).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <n1>Naruto</n1> was serialized in Shueisha's <b >shōnen manga</b> magazine <b>Weekly Shōnen Jump</b> from 1999 to 2014, with<br>
            its chapters collected in 72 <b>tankōbon</b> volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series by Pierrot and<br>
            Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes from 2002 to 2007; the English dub of the series aired on <b>Cartoon Network</b> and YTV<br>
            from 2005 to 2009. <b>Naruto: Shippuden</b>, a sequel to the original series, premiered in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500<br>
            episodes. The English dub was broadcast on Disney XD from 2009 to 2011, airing the first 98 episodes, and then switched over <br>
            to Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in January 2014, starting over from the first episode. Viz Media began streaming the <br>
            anime series on their streaming service Neon Alley in December 2012 on 99 episodes, and ended in March 2016, after 338 episodes. <br>
            Besides the anime series, Pierrot has developed eleven movies and twelve original video animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related <br>
            merchandise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed by several companies.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The anime series began airing in the United States and Canada in 2005, and in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2006 and 2007,<br>
            respectively. The films and most OVAs from the series were also released by Viz, with the first film premiering in movie theaters.<br>
            The story of Naruto continues with Naruto's son, Boruto Uzumaki, in Boruto: <b>Naruto Next Generations:</b> Boruto wishes to <br>
            create his own ninja way instead of following his father's.

            Naruto is one of the best-selling manga series in history having 250 million copies in circulation worldwide in 47 countries and<br>
            regions, with 153 million copies in Japan alone and remaining 97 million copies elsewhere. It has become one of Viz Media's<br>
            best-selling manga series; their English translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller<br>
            list several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga's character development, strong<br>
            storylines, and well-executed action sequences, though some felt the latter slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga,<br>
            which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism.
